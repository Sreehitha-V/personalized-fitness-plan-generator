# 🏋️ FitPlan AI: Personalized Fitness Plan Generator

## Objective
The objective of this milestone is to develop a foundational web-based fitness profile form that captures essential health data, validates user input, and implements accurate BMI calculation logic.

## BMI Formula Explanation
The application calculates BMI using the standard metric formula:

$$BMI = \frac{Weight (kg)}{Height (m)^2}$$

## Steps Performed
* **Form Creation**: Built an interactive dashboard using Streamlit to collect Name, Gender, Height, Weight, Fitness Goals, Equipment, and Level.
* **Input Validation**: Ensured no required fields are empty and that numerical values (Height/Weight) are positive.
* **BMI Classification**: Logic integrated to classify results into categories: Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese.
* **Deployment**: Successfully deployed the functional application to Hugging Face Spaces.

## Technologies Used
* **Frontend/Backend**: Python, Streamlit
* **Hosting**: Hugging Face Spaces
* **Version Control**: GitHub
